CSA Project regarding the Memory game
Memory game file- has the code for the game to actually run, it does not execute the code 
    - Variables that were used
        - Final Score & Final Rounds Private variables that is used at the end to store values
        - V1(), V2() are the methods that contain the code to run the memoery game, V1 runs the simple starter code, while V2 contains the addded features
            - some new features include: prompting the user to choose the harder mode, cutting time per question, randomizing the memString array to make it different every game, prompting User to want the randomized button feature
Memory game GUi file -has the visual components for the boxes popping up etc
    - A couple things were added for the propting questions that are implemented in the MemoryGame.java while such as using the "YES_NO" option void function in MemoryGameGUI.java in order to ask the User more questions about the game setting before the game starts 
PlotMaker
    - This file actually runs/executes the entire program, this also includes an end-of-the-game results graph that displays the score and rounds graph
        - the graph includes  y intercept, R(correlation), Axis
RandomPermutation file- used for randomizing differnet String arrays by generating int arrays with randomized order nums
    - nothing added, this was the code used from the 3.6.4 RandomPermutation assignment.
